## Introduction

In this exercise you will code along with the video to review the HTML fundamentals.

## Instructions

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your forked copy.
3. change directory into the repository folder.
4. Open the files in your code editor (in the video I use Sublime Text).
5. At this point in Terminal you would create any sub folders and files using the `mkdir` command and `touch` commands. We have already done this for you so you can get coding right away. In the code editor you will see we have already created the following files and folders.

```shell
├── README.md
├── contact.html
├── images
│   └── intro-pic.jpg
├── index.html
├── market-report.html
├── new-properties.html
├── real-estate-listings.html
└── spec
    └── ...
```
